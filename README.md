# Password_manager
>> In this project, I have created a streamlit application which asks the user to enter website, email/username and password.
>> We have an option to save the information of different website's username or password in a text file for future use.
>> We also have a button to generate a random password between 8-15 characters length.
>> This project was inspired by Coding Horror "Password Rules Are Bullshit" 😁
>> Enjoy the project by cloning the github code 😉
